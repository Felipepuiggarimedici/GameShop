This is my second Front-End project. I used React and Sass for the styles, as well as the components [Particles]https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-tsparticles.

## What is it about?
It is a fictitious e-commerce of various video games. Each game you can expand the details without reloading the page using React routing. From there, they can be added to the cart.


## The approach
Each set of components is divided into folders, in such a way that modularity is achieved.

## Particles
As I mentioned earlier I used tsparticles, along with its fire preset, to create a more interesting background.
